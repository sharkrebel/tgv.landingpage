# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Tam Giang Capital Landing Page

## 1. Executive Summary
The Tam Giang Capital Landing Page serves as the primary digital ecosystem portal for Tam Giang Group. It is designed to showcase the company's diverse portfolio—ranging from digital insurance services to high-tech agriculture—and to attract strategic investment partners.

## 2. Problem Statement
Potential investors and partners lack a centralized, high-quality portal to understand the full breadth of the Tam Giang Group's ecosystem. Previous fragmented web presences for individual verticals (e.g., muabhyt.vn, accfco.com) do not convey the group's unified strategic value and synergistic growth potential.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

- **Investor Attraction**: Effectively communicate the value proposition of the ecosystem to secure new capital.

- **User Engagement**: Provide clear calls to action (CTAs) for joining the investor network.
